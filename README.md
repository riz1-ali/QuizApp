***This app has all golang related code in go directory and the react related code in react-app directory.***

- This app is coded in React and relayed in backend using Golang. 
- We have an app for which the backend is implemented as a REST API. Frontend is in ReactJS.
- In this App, you can play Quiz(in the Quiz option), which have questions that have 10 points for each correct answer. 
- At the end of each quiz, you get to view your score. 
- You can view the scores of other people who attempted the quiz also in the View Score option.

For an Admin user
- He/she can view,delete and edit questions genre and quiz wise both. 
- You can also view the existing users. 
- For the sake of security, we have prevented adding the edit user option for now, as we believe the admin access to the database can be better.

A Lifeline has been implimented, which shows the answer of all questions in the quiz.
